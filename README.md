# Weather-Station-based-on-Raspberry-Pi
Final year project on a cheap Weather Station design based on raspberry pi . 
To measure the air temperature, air humidity, atmospheric pressure, inches of rain, relative 
altitude and light intensity by using Raspberry Pi platform.
As of now we have integrated the dht11 sensor for temperature and humidity and the bmp180 sensor for pressure and temperature.
I have used the Adafruit python package for both the sensors. Then using a simple pyhton program read those 
values and displayed at continuous intervals.
